Interactive cal(1) (but the name ical was taken)

.calirc.rb

This file lives in your home directory and is a Ruby script which gets required
if it exists. See dotcalirc.rb for an example.

dates
=====

The -d/--dates option takes a filename as an argument. That file should contain
linebreak-separated items containing strings of the form /\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/.

I have something similar in my home directory containing items such as:

2008-12-21 Start on RE essay, ML revision

2009-01-04 The L Word season 6 (final season)

2009-01-22 Shop meeting

It's a very simple diary. Try running:
./cali.rb -d README

The above dates should be underlined in the calendar, and pressing the
appropriate key should display the item below the calendar.
